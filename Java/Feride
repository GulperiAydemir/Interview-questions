1. What is variables in Java?
   Variables are containers for storing data values. We can say that is a name of memory location.
   There are different types of variables ,for example: int, double, char, String etc.
   Variables are fields like : size, color, weight...
2. What is an object in Java?
   In Java an object is an instance(sample) of a class. To create an object in java you need to have a class that defines
   its own set of variables and methods .
3. Difference between constructors and methods in Java.
   Constructors are used to create and initialize objects, while methods are used to define behavior that can be called
   on an object or class.
   Constructors do not have a return type and have the same name as the class, while methods have a return type and can
   have any method name same as class name or different.
4. What is Method Overriding?
   When we need to specify method, we change the method body, this is called overriding.We cannot touch “Method Signature”
   in overriding.Override cannot be final,static,private,method.For override must be parent child relationship(IS-A,HAS-A)
5. What is difference between static method and instance method?
   In summary, the main difference between static methods and instance methods in Java is that static methods belong to
   the class itself, while instance methods belong to individual instances of the class. Static methods are useful for
   performing operations that do not depend on the state of any particular instance, while instance methods are useful
   for performing operations that depend on the state of a particular instance.
